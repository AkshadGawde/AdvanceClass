## Description
This is a ReactJS based landing page template, suitable for an education website with a one-page view. The design is inspired by a template from [Free-CSS.com](https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page234/interact/). All 'visual' data can be easily modified by changing the `data.json` file.

## Make it Yours!
### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your PC. 

### 2. Cloning Files
Clone the repository and run the following commands in the CLI:
```bash
yarn
yarn start

npm i
npm start
```
### 3. Customize Your Data 
- Modify the data in the `data.json` file.
- Add images to `public/img/`.
- Customize styles by modifying the CSS files in `public/css/`.
- To make the contact form functional, create an EmailJS account, and modify `src/components/contact.jsx` to replace the service ID, template ID, and Public Key with your own.
